                    <p>The NovaHub SaaS product includes multiple components that is supplied to our clients.</p>
                    <p>The complex nature of the individual products means that they are ready at differing times and scales.</p>
                    <p>These products although architectured to work together are yet to be fully integrated.</p>
                    <p>The largest pain point is where the user downloads a list of customer ids from one product and then uploading them back onto the system to use another product on the same platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>User Experience Impact:</strong> This manual process created friction, increased the possibility of errors, and prevented users from efficiently leveraging data across different features. The goal was to enable users to seamlessly use data from one feature and apply it to another within the same platform.</p>

                    <p>‚õà I set up workshops with team leaders to understand how the products could talk to each other.</p>
                    <p>When designing I like to explore possibilities and generate ideas for near future expansions.<br>Although this could be dangerous in terms of thinking too far ahead we try to keep it realistic to what can be done in the next 6 months after Minimal Viable Product (MVP) delivery. This helps the teams plan ahead, in the hopes that this could reduce refactoring.</p>
                    <p>Alongside those sessions, userflows and wireframes are drawn to illustrate the happy paths.</p>
                    <p>I also used the design system to build out ideas to faciliate and illustrate idea generation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Strategic Approach:</strong> The integration was always planned, but I had to dive deeper to work around technical limitations and find elegant solutions. This required balancing user needs with technical constraints while maintaining the design system's consistency and scalability.</p>

                    <p>ü•° Using smaller increment releases helped us stay focused on what the needs of the user are. There is a danger in over designing, eg. you could plan out complex products that might not add a lot of value to a user.</p>
                    <p>The idea is that we continuously build, improve and keep teams in sync. This allows us to react to client demands and market trends.</p>
                    <p>In this project I learned that it is beneficial for all team members to define the end goal together but also firmly understand that changes can be made along the way to continuously deliver value.</p>
                    <p><strong>User Success:</strong> The integration successfully enabled users to seamlessly use data from one feature and apply it to another. User feedback indicated the solution was easier to use and significantly reduced the possibility for mistakes, demonstrating the value of thoughtful integration design.</p>
