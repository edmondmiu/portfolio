                    <h4>üëâ Internal Solutions</h4>
                    <p>We are building a backoffice suite that consisted of many products and their teams.</p>
                    <p>Design, organisation and brand fragmentation would occur without a foundation for all parties to rely on.</p>
                    <p>A design system holds together the rules that a designer is suggested to use. It helps the teams stay organised and facilitates the reuse of components.</p>
                    <p>This helps us remain efficient by helping us spend less time designing and developing components that could only be marginally different.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scale Challenge:</strong> As the sole designer supporting 6 developers and 50+ users, it would have been impossible to design every feature detail while maintaining consistency. The design system became essential for enabling rapid development without sacrificing quality.</p>

                    <p>It is where I began putting together the elements needed to form a solid foundation.</p>
                    <p>The elements include Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages.</p>
                    <p>Further reading into <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a> by Brad Frost is highly recommended.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scale & Implementation:</strong> Built approximately 5,000 components including nested variations over 2 months, with development accelerating as more reusable tokens and components were created. Used Material UI and Figma as primary tools, with the system still in active use 7 years later after one major code refactor.</p>

                    <h4>üìà Charts</h4>
                    <p>Being an information rich SaaS platform we needed colours that could be used to help categorise and provide visual cues to help the user understand related data.</p>
                    <p>The colours were chosen to keep harmony with the existing colour pallete with a slight leaning towards more saturation to help it stand out from the interface.</p>

                    <h4>üöÄ Action</h4>
                    <p>Action colours are signifiers that help the user identify locations of the interface that have interaction significance. A complimentry colour to the brand was chosen to allow the call to actions to stand out.</p>
                    <h4>üòê Neutral</h4>
                    <p>Usually in greyscale, it is a decision based on the principle that content is king. I wanted the content and the call to actions to remain the focus. This pallette helps form the largest part of the interface, as these colours are used to help separate the layout. It was important to get right with naming and organisation to aid easy colour changes when we move on to building a dark mode.</p>

                    <p>Much like the Neutral colour set surfaces was seperated out in preparation for allowing the interface to support more surface colours. A surface group would not have been needed but I wanted the flexibility to use more colours if the situation called for it. This decision was made purely for scalability and flexibility.</p>
                    <h4>üëã Response</h4>
                    <p>This colour set provides the response messaging, where the user has direct feedback from their interaction. It is split into Positive, Negative and Informative.</p>

                    <p>It is still the most efficient way to present a large amount of detailed data to users, and is well understood in its handling. From a usability perspective it minimalised the learning curve.</p>
                    <p>Within HTML there are 2 methods of organising, in rows and columns. This would depend on the data it is presenting and how that data is related to each other.</p>
                    <p>In the component library I had to account for these situations and build the design in a way to allow templates to be made with fluidity, and without disconnecting from the component library.</p>
