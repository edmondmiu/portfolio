                    <h4>üëâ Reduced betting market during off season</h4>
                    <p>During the off seasons there are limited events happening and users didn't have much choice in their betting opportunities. Users wanted a quick game inbetween moments, or a social space to hang out with entertainment.</p>

                    <h4>üéõ Quantitative Research</h4>
                    <p>From data gathered we see that there are 2 main access channels and users types.</p>
                    <p>üì± The online retail users who access via a mobile, and that is the main form of internet access. Most access would be done via an android device likely 1 ‚Äì 2 years old.</p>
                    <p>üè™ The cashier users, whose access to any product would be from a shop. They are exposed to marketing materials and try out new products that are promoted to them in these shops.</p>
                    <h4>‚öΩÔ∏è Qualitative Research</h4>
                    <p>We asked for help in this phase as local knowledge is vital in creating a product people want to use. We put together questions to ask what the users do when there are less sporting events happening. Most would fill the time either playing casino games, or football related mobile games.</p>
                    <p>In the shop the users have chosen to place bets via the cashier or self service tills. After speaking to locals the response is usually due to trust and having a person to physically interact with. Speaking with the cashiers who service the users, we find out these shops have turned into social gather spots where people hang out.</p>

                <div class="two-column-layout__content">
                    <p>üí® The user is able to use the real odds to place a bet on a simulated outcome. The bet would be settled immediately, and to prolong the opportunities, the user can bet on it again, with each bet made, it's outcome is re-simulated.</p>
                    <p>93% of the users from the host website were mobile users, so for the MVP this would be the first group to build for.</p>
                    <p>We had a ripe launch environment, leveraging the popularity of the host, and the user demand gave an opportunity for this app to succeed.</p>

                     <p>The logged in host user would enter the product via a switch on the bet slip. The challenge here was to allow the user to move seamlessly into another environment.</p>
                     <p>We needed to understand what information can be transfered from the host site, what data we needed to return to the host. Having clear needs defined helped us move quickly at a later stage as the host was larger, changes will inevitably be more complex and time consuming.</p>

                    <p>After the userflow was mature enough I started to wireframe, placing components and defining the look and feel of the branding, forming a rudimentry component library. This method allowed the FE to concurrently build reusable components into storybook. I had to make sure that FE was only building assets that were certain to appear in the app.</p>

                     <p>ü•° The steps of product design does not always work in the same order, it depends on the scope, launch environments, trade offs and the experience of the team.</p>
                     <p>When communicating animations and ideas, using illustrations to explain how you see it being put together helps to illustrate how you see an animation happening. Once the idea is understood the developer is only then able to solve the problem.</p>
                     <p>Developing the relationship between the developer and the designer is vital in order to realise designs. Trust and respect are the cornerstones of this.</p>
