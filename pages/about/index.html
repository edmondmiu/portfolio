                    <p>In my free time, I draw, take <a href="../gallery/index.html">photos</a>, and enjoy cooking.</p>
                    <p>Self learning is an important part of my core values. One of the ways I like to keep updated is learning about human centered design, and design team workflows.</p>
                    <p>Being part of a team, I bring my experiences as an innovator and leader to encourage creativity and communication.</p>

                        <h3>What makes a good designer?</h3>
                        <p>A good designer knows they must understand the aim, what it is they are trying to solve, and who the problem belongs to.</p>
                        <p>You can make a design pretty in a pinch; but form must follow function.</p>
                        <p>I believe a designer must love fixing problems, and should relish that challenge.</p>

                        <h3>Where do you find inspiration?</h3>
                        <p>I find inspiration everywhere. Particularly in people, books, and film.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-item">
                        <h3>What is in your toolkit?</h3>
                        <p>Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop and After Effects are my core tools. I also work with new-generation tools that use AI or natural language inputs to speed up idea-to-prototype cycles.</p>
                        <p>I'm tool-agnostic by design. The right tool is the one that helps you think better and test faster.</p>

                    <div class="qa-item">
                        <h3>What is your management style?</h3>
                        <p>I like to work in an environment where respect to others that are different is valued across all levels of a company.</p>
                        <p>Where you are encouraged to speak your mind when you see something that could be helpful.</p>
                        <p>No one knows everything and a fresh vision has always helped me bring light to a problem or one you didn't know existed.</p>
