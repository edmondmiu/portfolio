## If You're Happy With Changes

Merge the experimental branch back to main:

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge experimental branch
git merge optimization-ai-crawler

# Push to remote (if you have one)
git push origin main

# Delete experimental branch (optional)
git branch -d optimization-ai-crawler
```

## If You Want to Revert

Go back to the state before changes:

```bash

## Next Steps (Optional - Not Critical)

If you want to go further, these are nice-to-have improvements:

### üü¢ Medium Priority

1. **Add skip-to-content link** (accessibility)
2. **Add ARIA labels to mobile menu** (accessibility)
3. **Test color contrast** with browser DevTools
4. **Fix or remove /contact link** in header navigation

These aren't critical for AI crawler optimization but improve overall quality.
